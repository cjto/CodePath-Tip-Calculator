## Notes

As someone who is new to the field of Computer Science, Swift is only the second language I have been exposed to. I really enjoyed working on this prework project as it was very hands-on and applicable to my everyday life. Being able to create my very first iOS app did have its learning curve at first, but I was able to persevere and share my creativity through my work.
